Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Neuroscience at the American University, advised by Prof.Bei Xiao. I’m expected to graduate in December 2025 and am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities to continue my academic journey.

I’m interested in human visual perception and cognition, and in how insights from human perception and machine intelligence can mutually inform each another.

My current works focus on human visual perception of materials. Material perception plays an active role in connecting vision and action. We rely on visual information to reason about materials, estimate their physical properties, and guide behavior—for example, judging the ripeness of fruit or grasping glassware with appropriate force. Remarkably, we can often extract such information from material appearance within a single glance. I investigate this capability using a combination of human psychophysics and computational modeling, aiming to characterize how the mind builds a rich representation of materials that supports diverse behaviorally relevant tasks, such as estimating optical and mechanical properties, inferring material categories, and describing materials through language. In my view, material perception offers a powerful window into how humans make sense of the physical world.
